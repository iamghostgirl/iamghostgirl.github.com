title: Beginning

Lately I have been watching a lot of documentaries. They all have very different topics. Wrongful imprisonment (Paradise Lost, the Central Park Five). Religious exposees (Going Clear, Prophet's Prey). Hacktivist journalism (CitizenFour, the Hacker Wars). They all have one thing in common. Injustice.

But yesterday I watched [The Internet's Own Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXr-2hwTk58) and something inside me changed.

I have been tantalized by the world of hacktivism, privacy, freedom of information before, but this is different.

This is only the beginning.[^1]
